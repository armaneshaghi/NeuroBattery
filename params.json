Here we provide input data for a single subject for which 5 different images were acquired in a single session: MPRAGE, pseudo continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL), diffusion weighted/tensor, magnetization transfer, and resting state BOLD. Additionally we provide a template and associated labels/priors that we use as an anatomical basis for processing.\r\n\r\nThe processing consists of the following\r\n#T1 (MPRAGE)#\r\n1. Brain extraction\r\n2. 4-tissue segmentation\r\n3. Measurement of cortical thickness\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
