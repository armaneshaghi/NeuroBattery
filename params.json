Here we provide input data for a single subject for which 5 different images were acquired in a single session: MPRAGE, pseudo continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL), diffusion weighted/tensor, magnetization transfer, and resting state BOLD. Additionally we provide a template and associated labels/priors that we use as an anatomical basis for processing.\r\n\r\nThe general concept is to use the anatomical information in the T1 images as a spatial frame-of-refenece. Accoringly we find a spatial mapping between each subject's T1 image and the T1 template. Later, for additional MR images, we will perform intrasubject alignment to the T1 allowing for mapping to template space by composing multiple transforms and retaining the concept of relying on the T1 images for anatomical refenence. After aligning the T1 image to the template we generate various images relating to anatomical properties of the brain. \r\n\r\nT1 (MPRAGE) derived data\r\n------------------------\r\n1. Brain extraction mask\r\n2. 4-tissue segmentation (CSF,white matter, cortex, and deep gray matter)\r\n3. Cortical thickness\r\n\r\nIn the script directory, `process_t1.sh` provides an example call to `antsCorticalThickness.sh` which is used to achieve the steps listed above. The full command is:\r\n> sh  antsCorticalThickness.sh -d 3 \\  \r\n>    -a ../data/input/PEDS012/20121031/Anatomy/PEDS012_20121031_mprage_t1.nii.gz \\  \r\n>    -e ../data/template/T_template.nii.gz \\  \r\n>    -m ../data/template/T_templateProbabilityMask.nii.gz \\  \r\n>    -p ../data/template/Priors/priors%d.nii.gz \\  \r\n>    -t ../data/template/T_template.nii.gz \\  \r\n>    -k 1 \\  \r\n>    -n 3 \\  \r\n>    -w 0.25 \\  \r\n>    -o ../data/output/PEDS012/20121031/PEDS012_20121031_  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
